Even Sum Again

Description:
You are given a number stored in a variable with the name N
You have to print N lines such that on each line you find the sum of all even numbers in the range of[1,i], where I represents all the numbers in the range of[1,N]
For example, consider the value stored in N = 3,,Then, first we find the sum of all even numbers, in the range of [1,1], which comes out to be zero, as there are no even numbers in the range.
Then, we find the sum of all even numbers, in the range of [1,2], which comes out to be 2, as there is only 1 even number (2). Hence, the sum becomes 2
Finally, we find the sum of all even numbers in the range of [1,3], which comes out to be 2, as there is only 1 even number (2). Hence, the sum becomes 2

Input:
The first and the only line of the input contains the value stored inN
Output
Print N lines such that on each line you find the sum of all even numbers in the range of[1,i], where i represents all the numbers in the range of [1,N], as shown in the problem statement
